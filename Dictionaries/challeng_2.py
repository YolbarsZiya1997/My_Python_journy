# Challenge time!
# We have mentioned that the data for the Adventure game could be organized in many
# different ways.  We've created another way for you.
# Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to
# change the code to make it work.
# Below is the the complete program from the last video, but with the
# locations dictionary modified so that everything is in a single dictionary.
# N.B. Yes the code has some errors, thats what you need to fix!
